## Introduction
Education is widely believed to be the gateway to many opportunities, especially economical ones. There are many factors that can influence how education can be attained. This project will focus on possible correlations between upbringing, the types of education completed, employment eventually obtained, associated income and financial stance, geography, if all educational subjects are leading to equivalent economic success, and if the type of education background has an effect on resilience during economic crisis.
<br /><br />
Our focus will be on data within the United States. Our goal is to delve deeper into these subjects, and explore the possibility of any connections between them.
<br /><br />

## Findings
The data collected confirmed the financial benefit of having a higher education, specifically with a Bachelor's degree and above. The hourly wage of those with such degrees has trended up over the years, while those ranging from some college and below saw a flat to negative trend over time. <br>
<br /><br />
In addition, a positive correlation has been found between the median earnings for a worker in a specific area and the percentage of bachelor, master, and doctorate holders, constituting the population studied. It is to be noted that all degrees are not equally financially rewarding: bachelors with a major in engineering or in other scientific and technical fields are earning more than their counterparts who majored in business, and significantly more than those who studied liberal arts.<br>
<br /><br />
The data also shows that, in times of crisis (economic downturns, pandemics), those with higher education are relatively less at risk of becoming unemployed, regardless of their gender. Younger people between 16 and 24 are still dramatically more likely to be unemployed in such times, although the data available doesn't differentiate within this segment between those with or without a degree. Based on the typical age to complete a bachelor's degree (around 22 years old), it is probable that the majority of this segment was without a degree, hence the higher impact.<br>
<br /><br />

## Conclusion
Our analysis does confirm that higher education is worth having financially, albeit nothing short of a bachelor's degree has a true impact. The type of major associated with the degree has a significant effect of the financial outcome to be expected, with wages from scientific jobs outperforming all other sectors.
